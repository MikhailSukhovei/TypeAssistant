## Introduction

* Our application is designed to predict the next word from the text entered by the user

* We are considering the possibility of embedding our application in smart keyboards of mobile devices

* The accuracy of the model used allows us to guess the next word with an accuracy of about 20% (random sample), in addition, the probability that the correct word will be in the top three most likely words is 30% (random sample)
